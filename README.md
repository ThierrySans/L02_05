This is the repository for Problem Solvers. We have each introduced ourselves and agreed on our team's guidelines. We are on version 1 of our product backlog which consists of personas that represent future users of our software, user stories that reflect their user requirements, and tasks to implement the requirements of a userstory. We have also completed our first sprint and have its' sprint backlog below.
