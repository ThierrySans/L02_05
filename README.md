# L02_05
This is the repository for Problem Solvers. We have each introduced ourselves and agreed on our team's guidelines. We are on version 2 of our product backlog which consists of personas that represent future users of our software, user stories that reflect their user requirements, and tasks to implement the requirements of a userstory. We have also completed three sprints and have their sprint backlog's below.

**Features implemented:** 

**1:** Creation of multiple choice questions of 2-6 possible options.

**2:** Assigning questions to an assignment.   

**3:** Menu to be able to select what tool the user wants to access.

**How to run:** Must be using Windows with JDK 1.7 or later installed with the environment path to the JDK already set.

1. Navigate to L02_05/Quizzer/src via a windows command-line interface.
2. Type "javac application/Quizzer.java". If you receive " javac: command not found", your environment path to the JDK is probably not set correctly.
3. Type "java -classpath ".;../lib/sqlite-jdbc-3.20.0.jar" application/Quizzer"
4. You will be shown the main menu but cannot use any of the tools until you click "Setup" to initialize your database.
